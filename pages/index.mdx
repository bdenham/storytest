# Button

<Button variant="secondary">Button</Button>

Buttons trigger actions. The Base button comes in three variants: primary,
secondary, and tertiary.

## Examples

Button examples for the different variants, sizes, and states.

## Usage

### When to use

Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and interact with the page.
Usually, each page should have only one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower-emphasis buttons.

### When not to use

Do not use buttons as navigational elements.
Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Accessibility

Create custom doc block to display a table of accessibility and keyboard interactions.
